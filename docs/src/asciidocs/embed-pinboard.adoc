This page explains, through an example, how to embed a ThoughtSpot Pinboard in your Web page, portal, or application.

== Import the PinboardEmbed package
Import the PinboardEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,javascript]
----
import { SearchEmbed, AuthType, init, prefetch, EmbedEvent } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,javascript]
----
<script type='module'>
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init, prefetch } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

Specify the hostname or IP address of your ThoughtSpot application instance.

[source,javascript]
----
init
    ({
        thoughtSpotHost:"https://<hostname>:<port>",
    });
----
thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.

== Configure an authentication method

Define an authentication method. In the following example, the authentication method is set to SSO.

[source,javascript]
----
init
    ({
        authType: AuthType.SSO,
    });
----

include::{path}/embed-auth-config.adoc[]

== Prefetch static resources (Optional)

To prefetch static resources and load your application fast, set the `callPrefetch` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

== Configure security parameters

include::{path}/embed-config.adoc[]

== Construct the embed content
[source,JavaScript]
----
 const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed(
    document.getElementById('ts-embed'),
    {
	frameParams: {
		width: '100%',
		height: '100%',
	},
    disabledActions: [],
    fullHeight: true,
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>'
    hiddenActions: [],
    pinboardId: '<%=pinboardGUID%>',
    enableVizTransformations: true,
    preventPinboardFilterRemoval: true,
    runtimeFilters: [],
    },

});
----
frameParams:: 
Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the pinboard object. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage.

fullHeight __Optional__::
_Boolean_. Dynamically resizes the embedded pinboard frame according to the height of the pinboard.

+
If the embedded pinboard does not fit vertically within your application page, a second scroll bar may appear. When `fullHeight` is set to `true`, the embedded pinboard frame is automatically adjusted according to the height of the pinboard, and the second scroll bar does not appear.


defaultHeight::
_Integer_. Minimum height to set for embedded objects on a pinboard page and the corresponding visualization pages that a user can navigate to from the pinboard page. The default value is `500` pixels.


+

<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?fullHeight=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Preview in Playground</a>
++++


disabledActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to be disabled on the pinboards page.
+

For example, to disable the *Present* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the `Present` action menu string in the `disabledActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: Action.Present
----

<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
+
For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for disabling menu items, see  link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].


[NOTE]
====
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to disable this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute.

For example, if the custom action ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `disabledActions` attribute to disable this action on a pinboard page.
====

disabledActionReason::
_String_. Reason for disabling an action on a pinboard page.


hiddenActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to hide on the Pinboards page.
+

For example, to hide *Add filters* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the `AddFilter` action menu string in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: Action.AddFilter
----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
+
For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for hiding menu items, see  link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].

[NOTE]
====
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to hide this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

For example, if the custom action ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `hiddenActions` attribute to hide this action on a pinboard page.
====

pinboardId::
_String_. The GUID of the pinboard.
////
vizId [small]_optional_::
_String_. The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) of a visualization added to the pinboard.
////
enableVizTransformations::
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, it displays the contextual menu for visualizations. The contextual menu allows users to drill down a visualization, apply filters, and view detailed insights.

[#filter-removal]
preventPinboardFilterRemoval::
_Boolean_. When set to true, it disables the filter removal action and thus prevents users from removing the filters applied to a pinboard visualization.

runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the pinboard page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to filter data at the time of retrieval. Runtime filters allow you to apply a filter to a visualization in a pinboard and pass filter specifications in the URL query parameters.
+
Runtime filters do not appear to the user in the pinboard UI. They do not adjust the values of visible pinboard filters, but act as an additional set of filters - both runtime filters and UI filters will be applied within the queries.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:

+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
  columnName: 'Region',
  operator: RuntimeFilterOp.IN,
  values: ['Midwest', 'East', 'West']
  }]
----


columnName;;
__String__. Name of the column to filter by. 

operator;;
__String__. The runtime filter operator. For more information about the runtime filter operators, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc#runtimeFilterOp[Runtime filters].

values;;
__String, Integer, or Boolean__. The list of operands. Operators like EQ, LE accept a single operand, whereas other operators like BW and IN accept multiple operands.

++++

For more information about the supported data types and how to use runtime filters, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters].

== Define a method to process callback custom actions payload

include::{path}/callback-payload.adoc[]

== Subscribe to events

Register event handlers to subscribe to the events triggered by the embedded pinboard.

[source,javascript]
----
  pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
  pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
----

For more information, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Event subscription and handling].

== Render the embedded pinboard

Construct the URL for the embedded pinboard and render the embedded content:

[source,JavaScript]
----
pinboardEmbed.render();
----

== Test the embedded workflow

* Load the client application.
* Try accessing a pinboard embedded in your application.
* Verify the rendition.
* If you have disabled a menu item, verify if the menu command is disabled on the pinboards page.
* Verify the runtime filters.

== Additional resources

* For code examples, see xref:code-samples.adoc[Code samples].
