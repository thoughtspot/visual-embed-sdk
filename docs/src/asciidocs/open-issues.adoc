[options='header']
|===
|Issue ID |Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|SCAL-142933|The REST API v2.0 session login endpoint does not return session cookies. a|*Symptom*: The `/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login` endpoint does not return session cookies after a successful API call. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed when a REST client tries to log in to ThoughtSpot with basic authentication using the REST API v2.0 `session/login` endpoint. +

*Workaround*: Use one of the following options: +

* Use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API endpoint xref:authentication.adoc#bearerToken[to get a bearer token] and use it in the `Authorization` header to authorize your subsequent API requests.
* Use the REST API v1 endpoint `/tspublic/v1/session/login` to log in to ThoughtSpot and obtain session cookies.

|Issue ID |Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround

|SCAL-117106| The User account gets locked after a single bad token login attempt a|
*Symptom*: If a user attempts to log in to the embedded ThoughtSpot app with an invalid token, the application locks that user's account. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with the trusted authentication setup. +

*Workaround*: If you are using the trusted authentication method to authenticate your users, make sure the `getAuthToken` function in the SDK returns a fresh token for each re-login. Avoid using older tokens to renew a user session.
