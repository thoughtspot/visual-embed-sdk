:page-description: Customize styles, design, and layout of embedded ThoughtSpot app using UI and custom CSS

ThoughtSpot allows you to customize the look and feel of embedded pages and elements to match the UI style and design of your host application and branding guidelines of your organization. Developers can use the following options to customize the appearance of embedded content and create a uniform experience for the users of their app.

Style customization features in the ThoughtSpot UI::

You can customize key UI components, such as your application logo, favicon, font style for charts and tables, background color of the UI, background color of the top navigation panel, the color palette for your charts, page title, and footer text by either using the *Style customization* menu in the *Admin* tab or  navigating to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*. To learn how to use these controls, see xref:customize-style.adoc[Customize layout and styles].

Advanced style customization with custom CSS::
Custom CSS allows developers to override the default styles and UI element specifications in their deployments. Custom CSS provides granular control over the UI appearance and allows you to modify design elements such as buttons, labels, text styles, and typography. This feature is available only with the ThoughtSpot Everywhere Edition license.
+
To customize themes and variables in the CSS file, developers must know the basics of HTML and CSS framework and how to build custom themes. For more information, see xref:css-customization.adoc[Advanced customization with custom CSS].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you apply customization changes both via UI and custom CSS, the custom CSS changes take precedence and override the style customization settings in the UI.
