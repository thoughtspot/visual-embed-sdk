:page-description: You can connect users to their Slack workspace via app actions and allow them to push insights to a Slack channel 

With most businesses using Slack for communication and team collaboration, business users and analysts may want to deliver insights to their Slack workspace from the ThoughtSpot UI. ThoughtSpot makes it easier for your developers to automate the app integration workflow and enable seamless integration with your business apps. With app actions, users can now connect their Slack workspace with ThoughtSpot and push insights directly to their Slack channels. 


== Before you begin

To integrate Slack workspaces with ThoughtSpot, you will need the following: 

* A ThoughtSpot user account with developer or admin privileges to create app actions
* A ThoughtSpot user with a Slack account
* A ThoughtSpot application instance with *New Answer Experience* enabled
* A saved answer or Liveboard visualization


== Integration workflow

The Slack app integration workflow involves the following steps:

. A developer or admin user creates an app action for Slack in the Developer portal. 
+
This step sets Slack as a destination app.
. A user clicks a Slack app action on a saved answer or Liveboard visualization, and invokes the workflow. 

+
This step initiates the OAuth workflow to secure data transactions between the source and destination app. 
. ThoughtSpot requests access to the users' Slack workspace.
. The user authorizes the request. 

+
This step creates a pipeline between ThoughtSpot and the destination app for data exchange. 
. ThoughtSpot obtains a list of channels from the user's Slack workspace.
. The user selects a channel and clicks **Send now**.
. ThoughtSpot pushes the answer data or insights from the visualization to the specified channel in the specified file format.
