:page-description: Embed Full Application


Full embedding allows you to integrate the full ThoughtSpot content into an application.

== Full application embedding

The full embedded ThoughtSpot content gives your users the ability to perform many essential tasks:

* create answers and pinboards
* share objects with other users
* upload data, and refresh uploaded data
* relate uploaded data to existing worksheets
* use saved answers
* use SpotIQ

=== Limitations
Users in a fully embedded application cannot perform the following tasks:

* create worksheets
* create views
* modify profiles
* view the Help Center

== Full application embedding workflow

=== Import the AppEmbed package
Import the AppEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,javascript]
----
import { SearchEmbed, AuthType, init, prefetch, EmbedEvent } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,javascript]
----
<script type='module'>
import { AppEmbed, Page, AuthType, init } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

=== Initialize the SDK

To allow your client application to connect to ThoughtSpot, configure the URL with ThoughtSpot hostname or IP address.

[source,javascript]
----
init
    ({
        thoughtSpotHost:"https://<hostname>:<port>",
    });
----


thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.

=== Configure an authentication method

Define an authentication method. In the following example, the authentication method is set to SSO.

[source,javascript]
----
init
    ({
        authType: AuthType.SSO,
    });
----

include::{path}/embed-auth-config.adoc[]

=== Prefetch static resources (Optional)

To prefetch static resources and load your application fast, set the `callPrefetch` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

=== Create an instance of the AppEmbed object
Create an instance of the AppEmbed object and pass the parameters for the application page view.

[source,javascript]
----
 const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(
 document.getElementById('ts-embed'),
    {
     frameParams: {
         width: '100%',
         height: '100%',

     },
     disabledActions: [],
     disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>'
     disableHelpAndProfile: false,
     hideObjects: ['<object-id>'],
     hiddenActions: [],
     showPrimaryNavbar: true,
     pageId: Page.Data,
     path: '<url-string>',
     runtimeFilters: [],
     tag: '<tag-name>',
     
     },

  });
----
frameParams:: Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the pages in the web application. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage.

disabledActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to be disabled on the ThoughtSpot application pages.
+

For example, to disable the *download* action from the *More* (*...*) menu on the pinboard or visualization page, specify the `Download` action menu string in the `disabledActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----

disabledActions: Action.Download

----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++

+
For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for disabling menu items, see  link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].


[NOTE]
====
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to disable this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute.

For example, if the custom action ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `disabledActions` attribute to disable this action on a pinboard or answer page.
====

disabledActionReason::
_String_. Reason for disabling an action on a pinboard or visualization page. To display a tooltip for the disabled menu item, specify the reason for disabling the menu item in the `disabledActionReason` attribute.

disableProfileAndHelp::
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, the help and user profile buttons are hidden on the top navigation bar. You can use this attribute to hide these icons if the `showPrimaryNavbar` attribute is set to `true`.

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?disableProfileAndHelp=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Preview in Playground</a>
++++


hiddenActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to hide on a pinboard or visualization page.
+

For example, to hide the *Download* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the `Download` action menu string in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
+
----
hiddenActions: Action.Download
----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
+
For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for hiding menu items, see link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].

[NOTE]
====
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to hide this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

For example, if the custom action ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `hiddenActions` attribute to hide this action on a pinboard or answer page.
====

hideObjects [small]_optional_::
__Array of Strings__. Hides the specified objects. For example, if you do not want your application users to view certain pinboards, you can specify the GUIDs of the pinboards in the `hideObjects` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
hideObjects: ['11f5d5e8-2328-4817-a106-9eff17531e77','e2f49cdd-4d54-466a-841a-e7ecbd9b4400']

++++


runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the pinboard or visualization page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to pass filter specifications in the URL query parameters and filter data at the time of retrieval.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `100000` in the `Revenue` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [
{
      columnName: 'Revenue',
      operator: 'EQ',
      values: [ 100000 ]

},
]
----

For more information about the supported data types and how to use runtime filters, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters].

tag [small]_optional_::
__String__. Filters objects by the specified tag. If the pinboards and answers in your application are tagged as `Sales`, you can specify the tag string as `Sales` to show only those objects that have the `Sales` tag assigned. 
+
This attribute applies the tag filter at the application level. All metadata objects in the application, such as pinboards and answers, would be filtered by the tag.

+
[source, javascript]
----
tag: 'sales'
----

=== Define a method to process callback custom actions payload

include::{path}/callback-payload.adoc[]

=== Subscribe to events
Register event handlers to subscribe to the events triggered by the ThoughtSpot Search function; for example, application errors, and  embedded content initialization and loading.

[source, javascript]
----
 appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
 appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
----

For more information, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Event subscription and handling].

=== Render the embedded application
Render the embedded content.
[source, javascript]
----
appEmbed.render();
----

=== Test the embedded workflow

To verify the ThoughtSpot application integration, perform the following tasks:

* Load your application.
* Verify if the page you set as the active tab opens when you load the application.
* Verify if the tabs are displayed correctly.
* Verify if the page view parameters, such as hiding or showing the data source panel, function as expected.
* If you have disabled a menu item on a ThoughtSpot application page, verify if the menu command is disabled.
