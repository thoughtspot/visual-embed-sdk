:page-title: Embed Full Application
:page-pageid: full-embed
:page-description: You can embed full ThoughtSpot experience in your application and allow your users to create content for live analytics

The full app embedding allows you to embed the full ThoughtSpot application or the individual application pages in your app.

Full app embedding gives you all the features of ThoughtSpot, with the ability to use additional features and customization from the Visual Embed SDK, such as custom actions and CSS styling rules.

The basic layout and feature set of the various pages of the ThoughtSpot application in full app embedding is relatively fixed, so if you need more control, use the xref:embed-search.adoc[SearchEmbed] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[LiveboardEmbed] components. You can xref:page-navigation.adoc[control/customize navigation] within your web application using the full app or other embed components.

[NOTE]
====
We do not recommend mixing full app embedding with the xref:embed-search.adoc[SearchEmbed] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[LiveboardEmbed] components.
====

To embed the full ThoughtSpot application in your app, website, or product, complete the steps described in the following sections.  

== Import the AppEmbed package
Import the AppEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,javascript]
----
import {
    AppEmbed,
    Page,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
    EmbedEvent
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,javascript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        AppEmbed,
        Page,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch,
        EmbedEvent
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

xref:getting-started.adoc#initSdk[Initialize the SDK] and define authentication attributes.

== Create an instance of the AppEmbed object

Create an instance of the AppEmbed object and pass parameters to set a page view.

[source,javascript]
----
const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    pageId: Page.Data,
    path: '<url-string>',
    disabledActions: [],
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>',
    disableHelpAndProfile: false,
    hideObjects: ['<object-id>'],
    hiddenActions: [],
    showPrimaryNavbar: false,
    runtimeFilters: [],
    tag: '<tag-name>',
});
----

const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    additionalFlags: {
    <key>: <value>
    },
    disabledActions: [],

path::
_String_. The URL path of the ThoughtSpot application page that you want to embed. You can use this parameter to navigate your users to a specific page on your embedded instance. For example, to navigate your users to the `Monitor` page or a saved Answer, you can specify the `path` as shown here:

+
----
path: 'monitor'
----

+
----
path: 'saved-answer/96a1cf0b-a159-4cc8-8af4-1a297c492ff9'
----

+
To try it out on +++ <a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp" target="_blank"> Playground</a>+++, select the *Navigate to URL* checkbox and define the URL path.


[NOTE]
====
When both `path` and `pageId` attributes are defined, the `path` definition takes precedence.

runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the Liveboard or visualization page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to pass filter specifications in the URL query parameters and filter data at the time of retrieval.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `100000` in the `Revenue` column for a visualization in a Liveboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
    columnName: 'Revenue',
    operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
    values: [100000]
}]
----
