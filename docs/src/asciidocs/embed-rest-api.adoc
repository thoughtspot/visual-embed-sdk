:page-description: Embed Data using REST APIs

To query ThoughtSpot objects and embed them in a web page, portal, or application, you can use the data REST APIs. The data REST APIs return data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

== Embed Liveboard or visualization data
To embed a Liveboard or visualization, construct the URL for the REST API call:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the Liveboard from which you want to get data.
. Find the ID number of the object you want to get the data from.
+
To embed a Liveboard, click the ellipses (...) icon, and then select *Copy embed link*.

+
To embed a visualization:

.. Navigate to the table or chart
.. Click the ellipses (...) icon in the upper right corner of the table or chart.
.. Click *Copy embed link* icon.
+

. Copy the ID number from the link.
Paste it somewhere so that you can use it later to construct the URL for the REST API call.

+
If the object is a Liveboard, copy the identifier that appears after `viz/`.

+
For visualizations (table or chart), copy the IDs that appear after `viz/`.
+

. Construct the URL.
+
For a Liveboard, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<Liveboard_id>
----
+
For a visualization, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<Liveboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure you add brackets around the `vizid` parameter. The URL encoding for the opening bracket is `%5B` and the closing bracket is `%5D`.
====

+
. To apply filters to the data, use runtime filters.

+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a Liveboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:

+
----
http://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<Liveboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=color&op1=EQ&val1=red
----

. After you construct the URL, send a POST request to get data from ThoughtSpot.

+
The Data REST API returns the data formatted as JSON.
. Retrieve the data from the JSON and embed it in your Web page, Web portal, or application.

For more information, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters].

[NOTE]
====
Runtime Filters can also be applied on visualizations or Liveboards embedded in your application. You can specify the runtime filter criteria in the SDK when embedding ThoughtSpot objects. For more information, see xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a Liveboard].
