The trusted authentication method is a token-based authentication service, which uses a security token to authenticate ThoughtSpot users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content. 

== Key components

The trusted authentication workflow involves several entities, such as the web browser, host application, authenticator server, and the ThoughtSpot application server.

=== Authenticator server

If your organization has an authentication server, you can use it as a trusted authenticator server to authenticate ThoughtSpot users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content. 

The authenticator server performs the following functions:

* provide token-based authentication service
* Authenticate users who request access to the embedded content
* Request a token from ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf
* Return the token to the user's web browser

The authenticator server performs the following functions:

* Authenticates users who request access to the embedded content
* Requests a token from ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf
* Returns the token to the user's web browser 

+
[NOTE]
To use the trusted authentication method, you must add the authentication server domain to the allowed list for CORS. For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security settings].

=== ThoughtSpot server

For token-based authentication method, ThoughtSpot administrators must  xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[enable Trusted authentication] in the *Develop* > *Customization* > *Security Settings* page of the ThoughtSpot UI. This setting allows ThoughtSpot administrators to obtain a `secret key`, which is required for requesting access to ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf.

The trusted authenticator server also uses this secret key to obtain a security token.

=== Security token

The security token, also referred to as the authentication token, allows user to access the requested object. The token stays valid until another token is generated. 
 
== Trusted authentication workflow 
The embed user authentication workflow with a trusted authentication service involves the following steps:

. A user logs into the host application and requests access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.
. The host application sends a request for a user token to the trusted authentication server.
+
To proceed with authentication, the authentication server must determine the following:

 * if the requesting user has authenticated with the server.
 * which user (`username`) is making the request.
 * what is being requested: an object, page, or the entire ThoughtSpot application.
 * whether the requesting `username` matches a `username` added in ThoughtSpot.
. The trusted authenticator service then sends a `POST` request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login` endpoint. This step creates a session cookie that persists in subsequent API calls. 
. After establishing a session, the trusted authentication service sends a POST request to the ThoughtSpot server with the `secret_key` and `username` attributes to obtain an authentication token on the user's behalf.
+
----
POST /tspublic/v1/session/auth/token
----
+
This POST request body includes the following `formData` attributes:

* `secret_key`
+

__String__. The secret key obtained from ThoughtSpot.  

* `username`
+
__String__. The `username` of the ThoughtSpot user.  

* `access_level`
+
__String__. Mode of access. Valid values are:

** `FULL` 
+

Allows access to the entire ThoughtSpot application. When a token has been requested in `FULL` mode, it will create a full ThoughtSpot session in the browser and application. The token for `Full` access mode persists through several sessions and stays valid until another token is generated.


** `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW`
+
Allows access to only one object at a time. The token request for this access mode requires you to specify the GUID of the pinboard or search answer. If your application user requires access to another object, a new token request must be sent. 

* `id` 
+
__String__. The GUID of the pinboard or search answer. 
This parameter is required only for the `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` access mode.

. ThoughtSpot verifies the authentication server's request and returns a token.
. The authentication server returns the token to the user's web browser.
. The client application constructs a fully encoded URL with the authentication token and the embedded resource endpoint and sends it as a query parameter in the GET request to the ThoughtSpot application server.

----
GET https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/session/login/token?username=<user>&auth_token=<token>&redirect_url=<full-encoded-url-with-auth-token>
----
The request URL includes the following attributes:


* `username`
+
_String_. The `username` of the user requesting access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

* `auth_token`
+
_String_. The authentication token obtained for the user in step 5.

* `redirect_url`
+
_String_. The URL to which the user is redirected after successful authentication. The URL is fully encoded and includes the authentication token obtained for the user.
+
For example, if the user has requested access to a specific visualization on a pinboard, the redirect URL includes the domain to which the user is redirected, the auth token string obtained for the user, visualization ID, and pinboard ID.
+
[source, HTML]
----
https://<redirect-domain>/?authtoken=<user_auth_token>&embedApp=true&primaryNavHidden=true#/embed/viz/<pinboard_id>/<viz-id>
----
[NOTE]
The request URL includes the `auth_token` attribute and the redirect URL uses the `authtoken` attribute.

. ThoughtSpot validates the request and allows access to the requested content.

The following illustration depicts the trusted authentication workflow:

== Trusted authentication workflow with Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK simplifies and automates the trusted authentication workflow. 

. The SDK checks for an existing user session in the browser.
. If there is no session, it obtains a token either from the specified `authEndpoint` URL, or by using the `getAuthToken` callback method. 
. The SDK uses the obtained token and `username` in the GET request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint.
. If the request is successful, the SDK renders the embedded content. 

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Embed user authentication].

== Enable trusted authentication
You need ThoughtSpot admin privileges to enable trusted authentication.

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot.
. Click the *Develop* tab.
. Under *Customizations*, click *Settings*.
. To enable trusted authentication, turn on the toggle.
+
A secret key for trusted authentication is generated. This secret key is required for obtaining an authentication token for a ThoughtSpot user.

. Click the clipboard icon to copy the token.
+
The following example shows a ThoughtSpot-generated secret key string.

----
b0cb26a0-351e-40b4-9e42-00fa2265d50c
----
This key is required for making API calls to get a token for ThoughtSpot users.

. Store the key in a secure location.
. Click *Save Changes*.


== Disable trusted authentication

To disable trusted authentication, follow these steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, turn off the *Trusted Authentication* toggle.
+
A pop-up window appears and prompts you to confirm the disable action.

. Click *Disable*.

+
When you disable trusted authentication, the validity of your existing authentication token expires. Your application will become inoperable until you add a new token to it.
To generate a new token, re-enable trusted authentication.
