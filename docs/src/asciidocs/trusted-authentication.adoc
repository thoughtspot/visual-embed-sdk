:page-description: You can configure support for token-based authentication service on ThoughtSpot.

Trusted authentication defines a *method* for requesting *login tokens* using the ThoughtSpot REST API. The login token is only necessary during the login process, after which any request to ThoughtSpot will include session cookies identifying the signed-in user.

== Overview
Trusted authentication establishes a ThoughtSpot session in the browser without requiring a user to sign in directly to ThoughtSpot or be redirected to a third-party IdP. It is the most seamless method of single sign-on (SSO), but requires more of the application developer to secure the process.

The *login token* from the ThoughtSpot V1 REST API is a simple, proprietary token. The authentication token of the V2 REST API is not currently used in the trusted authentication flow.

*Securely requesting the login token* requires passing authentication details from the embedding application securely to an *authenticator service* with access to the `secret_key` for the ThoughtSpot instance and ThoughtSpot admin user's credentials.

The process for trusted authentication is as follows:

 1. The Visual Embed SDK, loaded within the embedded application page, calls the `init()` function with the correct set of parameters to request a *login token*.
 2. The request for the *login token* securely provides the username and any additional details to the *authenticator service*.
 3. The *authenticator service* verifies and parses the username and other details, and issues REST API commands to ThoughtSpot, at minimum requesting a *login token* for the provided username.
 4. The *authenticator service* returns the *login token* to the browser and the Visual Embed SDK.
 5. The Visual Embed SDK issues requests to establish a ThoughtSpot session in the browser.

[#trusted-auth-enable]
== Get a secret key for trusted authentication
You need ThoughtSpot admin privileges to enable trusted authentication.

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot.
. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit*.
. To enable trusted authentication, turn on the *Trusted authentication* toggle.
+
A `secret_key` for trusted authentication is generated. This `secret_key` is required for obtaining an authentication token for a ThoughtSpot user.

. To copy the secret key, click *Edit* again, navigate to *Trusted authentication*, and then click the clipboard icon.
+
The following example shows a ThoughtSpot-generated secret key string.

[#trusted-auth-sdk]
== Visual Embed SDK / front-end

The Visual Embed SDK automates the login token request and subsequent login request using the returned login token.

The request to the *authenticator service* is defined in the `init()` function of the Visual Embed SDK. When `init()` is called, the SDK checks if there is an existing ThoughtSpot session for the instance in the browser. If not, it will request a *login token* from either the `authEndpoint` URL or the `getAuthToken` callback function. The xref:embed-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-embed[Embed user authentication page] shows the exact forms to use for these two properties.

=== Secure the authentication details request
For the request to the *authenticator service* to be secure, the user in the browser cannot modify the request or make their own valid request to the *authenticator service*.

How your particular application can most easily securely request the *login token* is up to you, but how you choose to send the message will constrain your choice between `authEndpoint` or `getAuthToken`.

When using `getAuthToken`, you specify a function that returns a Promise that resolves with the *login token*. Within the callback function, you can define the request to the *authenticator service* with far greater control than the automated `GET` request to a URL used by the `authEndpoint` option. `getAuthToken` is the preferred method for production deployments unless your *authenticator service* is implemented within the existing API endpoints of your application and a simple GET request provides the necessary authentication details as shown here.

The following example shows a callback function with a custom request using link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch[Fetch, window=_blank], which returns a Promise. You can also use link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest[XHR, window=_blank] and build the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise, window=_blank] manually.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: tsURL,
    authType:  AuthType.TrustedAuth,
    getAuthToken: getAuthToken,
    username: username
  });
}

function async getAuthToken {
  const tokenURL = tokenServiceURL + "/gettoken/";
  console.log("calling token server at " + tokenURL);

  const timeoutSecs = 5 * 1000; // seconds to milliseconds

  const response = await timeout(timeoutSecs, fetch(
    tokenURL,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      mode: 'cors',
      cache: 'no-cache',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': "text/plain",
        'X-TS-Auth-Token': tsAuthJWT
      },
      credentials: 'include'
    }
  ))

  // Have to return a promise for the auth SDK.
  //console.log(await response.text());
  return response.text()
}
----

If you choose `authEndpoint`, a GET request is made directly to the provided URL. The authentication details must be included by the browser in this automated GET request, typically in the cookies. Cookies are not sent across domains (only to sub-domains), so your *authenticator service* must be *hosted in the same domain* as the embedding application.

Because the requirements around matching domain hosting can be difficult to set up during a quick testing phase, you may see examples of a trusted authentication flow using `authEndpoint` with the username sent in the clear as a URL parameter. Note that this is *only for testing purposes* and *is not secure*.

== Authenticator service / back-end

The authenticator service should exist at the web application tier of your networks, with secure access to the ThoughtSpot `secret_key` and the credentials of a ThoughtSpot administrator user (typically a service account).

There are no requirements to how the authenticator service is built or hosted, other than being able to issue REST API commands to the ThoughtSpot instance and having access to the `secret_key`. ThoughtSpot generates a `secret_key` when trusted authentication is enabled on a ThoughtSpot application instance. When using a ThoughtSpot cloud instance, the authenticator service will need outbound request access to the hosted ThoughtSpot cloud instance.

The simplest *authenticator service* does the following steps, assuming ThoughtSpot users already exist from another process:

1. Verify and parse the authentication message to retrieve the ThoughtSpot username.
2. Request a login token from ThoughtSpot using REST API v1.
3. Return the token to the user's web browser.

If user creation and group assignment must be performed at the time of the login token request, the *authenticator service* must follow the steps described in the xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#_just_in_time_user_provisioning_and_group_assignment[Just-in-time user provisioning and group assignment] section of this article.

=== Verify and parse the authentication message
As mentioned in the preceding section, the exact way you send the authentication details varies with your implementation. The *authenticator service* must verify the request and then parse out the details (at minimum, the *ThoughtSpot username* value) so that they can be used in the subsequent REST API requests to ThoughtSpot.

The *authenticator service* will need access to whatever code and other services are necessary to parse out the authentication details. For example, if you are sending through an OAuth token from an IdP, the IdP may provide a library or set of instructions using standard libraries. If using the application's existing session system, there will be some way to retrieve the username based on the session details from the request. You can also define your own JWT or some other secure way for your web application to send the message securely.

If your *authenticator service* must also create users and give them access, you must parse out additional details from the request:

- user email address
- user display name
- ThoughtSpot group names to add a user to

User password is not required in the login token request. It can be randomly generated if creating a user account in ThoughtSpot so that the user can only sign in via the embedding application.

=== REST API session sign-in
The *authenticator service* makes REST API requests to ThoughtSpot. To make a REST API request for a login token, the *authenticator service* must have xref:api-auth-session.adoc[created an active session] with ThoughtSpot user with *server administrator* privileges, typically a service account created only for use by the *authenticator service*.

The authenticator service code will need logic to log in if there is no active session and secure access to the service account credentials. How you protect and securely access the service account credentials is up to you in the design of the service. Any examples with a username and password entered directly in the code are for *testing purposes only*.

=== Login token request via REST API
The only other REST API call *necessary* after sign-in is the xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[request for the login token]. This is the call that utilizes the `secret_key`, which the *authenticator service* must also securely store and access along with the service account user credentials.

When a token has been requested in `FULL` mode, it will create a full ThoughtSpot session in the browser and application. The token for `FULL` access mode persists through several sessions and stays valid until another token is generated.

There is the option to request a limited token using the `access_level=REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` option, but this is rarely used and not recommended. Access control in ThoughtSpot (called Sharing) prohibits a signed-in user from loading any content they aren't assigned access to.

Access control (sharing) can be granted during the login token request process by adding the user to the appropriate ThoughtSpot groups.

=== Just-in-time user provisioning and group assignment

Starting from 8.9.0.cl, the xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token] endpoint supports just-in-time provisioning of users. If the user specified in the API request does not exist in the ThoughtSpot system, you can set the `autocreate` property to `true` to add the user to ThoughtSpot and assign the user to `groups`.

The typical flow of REST API requests for user creation at the time of a login token request is as follows:

1. Make a REST API request to xref:user-api.adoc#get-user-details[get the user details].
2. If the user already exists, compare the `assignedGroups` property for the user with the group they should belong to.
3. If the user doesn't exist in ThoughtSpot, you can either xref:user-api.adoc#create-user[create a new user] or set the `autocreate` property to `true` in your API request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint. You can also specify the group names to add the user to groups in the same API request.
4. If the user should belong to other groups, add group names in the `groups` property when making API call to the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint. 
6. Request a login token from ThoughtSpot via `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` API endpoint.
7. Return the token to the user's web browser.
 

=== Additional REST API requests
Because all of ThoughtSpot administration is possible via the REST API, you can incorporate even more functionality into the *authenticator service* if necessary, building it into an authentication and authorization service. The xref:api-user-management.adoc[user and group privileges] REST API documentation covers the additional requests related to authorization.

For example, you could implement the xref:group-api.adoc#create-group[create group] REST API for ThoughtSpot groups that are intended for use in Row Level Security (RLS) rules. For these groups, the group name must match exactly with a value in a column in the data warehouse, so the name of the group itself serves as a __data entitlement__. You could adjust the flow described in the preceding section to create any group for RLS that did not already exist and assign it to the user, which would bring the process closer to a Role-based access control (RBAC) or Attribute-based access control (ABAC) pattern.


== Disable trusted authentication

To disable trusted authentication, follow these steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit* and turn off the *Trusted authentication* toggle.
+
A pop-up window appears and prompts you to confirm the disable action.

. Click *Disable*.

+
When you disable trusted authentication, the validity of your existing secret key expires. Your application will become inoperable until you add a secret key to the authenticator service.
You must re-enable trusted authentication and then obtain a new secret key.

[#login-token]
== Login token expiration

The login token, also referred to as the authentication token, allows users to access the requested object. It is a proprietary token format that cannot be decoded or used for any purpose other than to create a ThoughtSpot session.

Tokens stay valid for a length of time based on the following rules:

* A token stays valid indefinitely until another token for any user is generated.
* When a new token is generated using the same `secret_key`, the previous token will expire after five minutes.
* When a new `secret_key` is generated for the ThoughtSpot server and the first new login token is obtained using the new `secret_key`, all tokens generated using the previous `secret_key` become invalid.
* If users make multiple attempts to log in to ThoughtSpot using an invalid or expired token, they may get locked out of their accounts.

To set a consistent five-minute expiration time, you can generate a second token to start the expiration clock for the previous login token that is sent to the user's browser.

== Troubleshoot trusted authentication

[NOTE]
====
All SSO methods in ThoughtSpot create a ThoughtSpot session using cookies. Please confirm that your browser is set to allow "third-party cookies" when testing trusted authentication. Chrome now blocks third-party cookies in Incognito mode by default, while Safari blocks them by default even in standard mode.
====

== Implement without Visual Embed SDK
The Visual Embed SDK handles the final REST API request to create the session, but it is possible to perform the login using the xref:session-api.adoc#session-loginToken[/session/login/token endpoint] directly.

[NOTE]
====
* The REST API v1 login token is not used for establishing a REST API session for backend processes or administration scripts. Use the xref:session-api.adoc#session-login[/session/login] endpoint with username and password to create a REST API session.
* The REST API v2[beta betaBackground]^Beta^ does have an OAuth token mechanism, which is also separate from the REST API v1 login token and not part of the trusted authentication flow at this time.
====

REST v1 clients can make a `GET` or `POST` API call to the xref:session-api.adoc#session-loginToken[tspublic/v1/session/login/token] API endpoint to log in a user. Note that the `GET` call to the `tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint must include a fully-encoded URL with the authentication token and resource endpoint in the request URL.

----

ThoughtSpot recommends sending the authentication attributes in a `POST` request body instead of a `GET` call.

----
curl -X POST \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'username=tsuser&auth_token=JHNoaXJvMSRTSEEtMjU2JDUwMDAwMCRtL3dWcVo2ZTdWTzYvemdXN1ZoaTh3PT0kdmlyNnQ4NHlwYXlqNFV4VzBpRlNYbmQ1bzk5T1RFK2NVZy9ZRUhvUEkvST0&redirect_url=https://<ThoughtSpot-Host>/?embedV2=true#/pinboard/7a9a6715-e154-431b-baaf-7b58246c13dd%2F' \
'https://<ThoughtSpot-Host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/session/login/token'
----

The API request must include the following attributes:

* `username` +
_String_. The `username` of the user requesting access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

* `auth_token` +
_String_. The authentication token obtained for the user.

* `redirect_url` +
_String_. The URL to which the user is redirected after successful authentication.
