:page-description: ThoughtSpot REST API v2 Playground

The REST API Playground [beta blueBackground]^BETA^offers an interactive portal with comprehensive information about the API endpoints, request and response workflows.

The Playground allows you to make REST API calls in the programming language of your choice. You can also view the SDK, request and response workflow.

== Access Playground

To access the REST Playground v2, click *Develop* > *REST API* > **REST Playground v2**.

== Explore the interface

The API Playground consists of following areas:

Resource pane::

In the resource pane, you can find a catalog of API endpoints, grouped based on the objects they operate on. You can also view the API documentation, data structure of requests, response format, and attribute enumerations.

+
The search bar in the resource pane allows you to search for an endpoint and navigate between different endpoints in the list.

API request editor::

The middle section of the portal provides a short description of the endpoint, endpoint URL, request parameters, and response codes. For parameters that require a JSON array, you can add each array separately. For example, if you are assigning privileges to a group, you can add each privilege string as an array.

Code explorer::

The code explorer offers several distinct features:

* Code panel
+
Shows a preview of the API request code. You can view the request body as you edit the input parameters and define attributes in the API editor area. The code explorer dynamically changes the API request format based on the language you select.

* Try it out 
+
Allows you to trigger an API call. If the request succeeds, the API returns the 200 response code. You can copy or download the entire API response. You can also copy the individual attributes using the copy button that appears next to the field. To try another API call, click **Back**.

* Copy  icon
+
Allows you to copy API requests and responses.

* Configuration panel
+
Allows you to modify the client configuration settings. For example, you can update the access token of the client. You can also specify if you want to download the code files with bootstrapping and error handling details. To view this panel, click **Configure**.  

* Download icon
+
Allows you to download the API response JSON file to your local directory.
 
Language selection drop-down::

The language selection drop-down above the code explorer allows you to switch between different programming languages and view code samples. You can also use this drop-down to get language-specific SDK and client libraries.
