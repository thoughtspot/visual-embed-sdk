:page-description: Overview of custom actions

ThoughtSpot users with developer privileges can access the *Custom actions* page by clicking *Develop*  > *Customizations* > *Custom actions*. The *Custom actions* page includes the following features:

Create action::
The *Create action* button allows you to create a custom action  xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[to send data to a URL] or xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[trigger a callback to the parent application]. Your application users can access these custom actions by clicking the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[the Custom actions icon] on a visualization page.

* Global actions
+
The ThoughtSpot Developer portal allows you to add a custom action to all visualizations. If you want to create a custom action that will appear on all charts and tables, you can create a *Global* action. For example, if you want to create a custom action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add it globally to all visualizations. To add a custom action to all visualizations, you must enable the *On by default on all visualizations* checkbox when you create a custom action in the Developer portal.

* Local actions
+
You may want to add a custom action to only a specific visualization. To do this, you can set a custom action as a *Local* action when you create a custom action in the Developer portal. If you do not select *On by default on all visualizations* checkbox in the custom action creation page, ThoughtSpot automatically categorizes it as __local__ action. Any user with edit privileges can xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[add this action to a single visualization] or xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[all new visualizations generated from a specific worksheet].

[#access-control]
* Access control 
+
The custom action feature allows you to build additional functionality and add them as actions to the ThoughtSpot UI. If you want to restrict user access to custom actions, you can use the following configuration options:   

** Only developer or admin users can create custom actions in the Developer portal. 
** Developers can designate these actions as `Global` or `Local`. The `Global` actions are available for visualizations, whereas `Local` actions can be added to a specific visualization by a business user or data analyst.
** Only users with edit permissions to a visualization can xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[add a `Local` action to a visualization] on a Liveboard. Similarly, only users with edit permissions to a worksheet can xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[add a `Local` action to answers built from a specific worksheet].
** For granular access control, developers can further restrict a custom action's availability to only users belonging to a specific user group. The **Show advanced availability** setting in the xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[custom action creation and edit] pages allows you to associate custom actions to specific user groups. By default, all users can access custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI.  


Overview::

The *Overview* tab shows the possible locations of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. You can add a custom action as a primary menu, or as a menu item in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu. You can also add the custom action to the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on a visualization in the *Answers* or *Liveboards page*.

+
By default, ThoughtSpot adds all custom actions to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set obtained from a visualization, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu. If you want to change the position of an existing custom action, click the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[custom action icon] on a visualization page, and edit the custom action. 

My actions::
The *My actions* tab lists the custom actions that are available on your ThoughtSpot instance. This page also allows you to edit or delete a custom action configured on your instance.
