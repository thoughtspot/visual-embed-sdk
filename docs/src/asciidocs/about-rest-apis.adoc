:page-description: About REST APIs

The ThoughtSpot REST APIs enable your client applications to access data from the ThoughtSpot application.
Client applications can use the REST APIs for the following purpose:

* get pinboard and visualization data from the ThoughtSpot application.
* get ThoughtSpot data by programmatically sending a search query.
* list the metadata object and visualization headers in the repository.
* transfer ownership of all objects from one user to another and more.
* embed data from visualizations and pinboards in a web page, portal, or application.

The REST APIs return data as a JSON string. To embed data into your application, extract the data from the JSON file, and render it on your Web page.

REST APIs retrieve live data from ThoughtSpot, so whenever the Web page is rendered, the current values will be shown.
