:page-description: Add custom actions

ThoughtSpot lets you add custom actions globally to all your visualizations or locally to a specific visualization or worksheet. By default, the actions created in the Developer portal are set as *Global* actions. Developers can choose to set an action as **Local** and allow their application users to assign it to a visualization or saved answer of their choice. By default, local custom actions are not assigned to any visualization. Any ThoughtSpot user with edit access to a visualization, saved answer, or worksheet can add a local action to the objects of their choice. For example, if you want to send data from a specific visualization to the pre-configured URL or web page, you can add a custom action locally to that visualization.

If custom actions are configured for your instance, the UI displays these actions in the *Custom actions* panel. The *Custom actions* panel allows authorized users to  perform the following tasks:

* Add a local action to a visualization or saved answer
* Edit the position of an action
* Delete a **Local** action association
* Hide a *Global* action that is not relevant to your answer or visualization.

To view the *Custom actions* panel, navigate to a saved answer page, or open a Liveboard visualization in the edit mode, and then click the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[the Custom actions menu].
