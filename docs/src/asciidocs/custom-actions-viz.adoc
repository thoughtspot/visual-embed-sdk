:page-description: Add custom actions

ThoughtSpot lets you add custom actions globally for all your visualizations in the Developer portal. You can also add a custom action to a specific visualization from the *Answers* or *Pinboards* page. For example, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can add a custom action locally to that visualization. 

To view the custom actions available on your cluster, you can open a visualization from a pinboard or search answer, and click the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[the Custom actions menu]. If you have edit permissions to modify the visualization, the *Custom actions* panel allows you to perform the following actions:
