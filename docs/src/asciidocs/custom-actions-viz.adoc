= Add a custom action to a visualization

:page-title: Actions customization

:page-description: Add custom actions

ThoughtSpot lets you add custom actions globally to all your visualizations or locally to a specific visualization or Worksheet. By default, the actions created in the Developer portal are set as *Global* actions. Developers or administrators can choose to set an action as **Local** and allow their application users to assign it to a visualization or saved Answer of their choice.

If custom actions are enabled on your instance, the UI displays these actions in the *Custom actions* panel on a saved Answer or visualization page.  By default, local custom actions are not assigned to any visualization. Any ThoughtSpot user with edit access to a visualization, saved Answer, or Worksheet can add a local action to the objects of their choice. For example, if you want to send data from a specific visualization to the pre-configured URL or web page, you can assign a URL action to that visualization.

If you have access to a custom action, ThoughtSpot lets you perform the following tasks:

* Add a local action to a visualization or saved Answer
* Edit the position of an action
* Remove a **Local** action from a visualization or saved Answer
* Hide a *Global* action

* The link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[new Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster.
* The custom action is available on your instance and is set as *Local*.
* You have edit permission to modify the visualization or saved Answer.
