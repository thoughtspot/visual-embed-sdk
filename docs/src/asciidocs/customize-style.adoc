=== How chart colors work
ThoughtSpot picks colors and hues in a specific order. For example, a primary color, lighter hue, and a hue that is darker than the primary color. The standard color palette in ThoughtSpot uses the following color format by default:
[width="100%"]
[options='header']
|====
| Primary 1 (P1) | Primary 2 (P2) | Primary 3 (P3) | Primary 4 (P4) | Primary 5 (P5) | Primary 6 (P6) | Primary 7 (P7) | Primary 8 (P8)
| Lightest 1 (L1) | Lightest 2 (L2) | Lightest 3 (L3) | Lightest 4 (L4) | Lightest 5 (L5) | Lightest 6 (L6) | Lightest 7 (L7) | Lightest 8 (L8)
| Light 1 (l1) | Light 2 (l2) | Light 3 (l3) | Light 4 (l4) | Light 5 (l5) | Light 6 (l6) | Light 7 (l7) | Light 8 (l8)
| Dark 1 (d1) | Dark 2 (d2) | Dark 3 (d3) | Dark 4 (d4) | Dark 5 (d5) | Dark 6 (d6) | Dark 7 (d7) | Dark 8 (d8)
| Darkest 1 (D1) | Darkest 2 (D2) | Darkest 3 (D3) | Darkest 4 (D4) | Darkest 5 (D5) | Darkest 6 (D6) | Darkest 7 (D7) | Darkest 8 (D8)
|====


image::./images/chart-color-palette-format.png[Standard chart color format]

ThoughtSpot applies the same format for custom color palettes. To know more about the color selection algorithm and criteria for charts, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/chart-color-change#_how_chart_colors_work[How chart colors work, window=_blank].

=== Define a custom color palette for charts

To change the color palette for charts:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*.
. Click the background color box under *Chart Color Palettes*.
. Click the color you would like to change in the *primary* color palette, and use the color menu to choose your new color.
+
You can also add a HEX color code.
. Click the color you would like to change in the *secondary* color palette, and use the color menu to choose your new color.
You can also add a HEX color code.
+
The colors from the secondary color palette are used after all of the primary colors from the primary palette have been exhausted.
Therefore, the secondary palette usually consists of secondary colors.

=== Configure color rotation

If the chart requires only one color, ThoughtSpot selects a primary color depending on whether you enabled color rotation. The *Color rotation* feature determines whether single-color charts use a random primary color or always use the first primary color in the palette. If you enable Color Rotation, ThoughtSpot picks colors randomly and may choose any color from Primary 1 through Primary 6 in your color palette for single-color charts. If you disable Color Rotation, ThoughtSpot always chooses Primary 1.

If you disable color rotation, ThoughtSpot generates single-color charts in the order of your color palette, left to right.

[#footer-text]
== Customize footer text
A footer appears by default in the ThoughtSpot application. You can customize the footer text to add your  company-specific message.

To change the footer text:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*.
. Click the text box under *Footer text*.
. Enter your new text message.
+
Your new text message will automatically be displayed in the footer.

[#page-title]
== Customize page title

To customize the page title displayed in the browser bar:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*.
. Click the text box under *Page title*.
