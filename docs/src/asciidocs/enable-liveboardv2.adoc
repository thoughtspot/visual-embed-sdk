:page-title: New Liveboard experience
:page-pageid: Liveboard-new-experience
:page-description: You can enable the new Liveboard experience on Liveboards embedded using the `LiveboardEmbed` or `AppEmbed` SDK library.

The new Liveboard experience in ThoughtSpot includes several new features and user-experience improvements. Users with developer or administrator privileges can enable the new Liveboard experience at the cluster level and set it as the default experience for all users. Individual application users can also set the Liveboard experience preference on their profile settings page.

[NOTE]
====
The new Liveboard experience is Generally Available (GA) on embedded instances starting from 9.0.0.cl.
====

== Enable new Liveboard experience for all users

You can enable the new Liveboard experience using one of the following options:

* Go to *Admin* > *Search & SpotIQ* and edit the Liveboard experience preference.
* Set the `liveboardV2` attribute in the SDK to `true`.
+
If the `liveboardv2` attribute is not set in the SDK, ThoughtSpot will use the Liveboard experience setting applied at the cluster level. If the new Liveboard experience is enabled in the SDK, it will take precedence over the setting applied at the cluster level in the `Admin` tab.

+
The following examples show how to enable the new Liveboard experience on an embedded ThoughtSpot application:

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardV2: true,
});
----

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardV2: true,
});
----

== Liveboard experience

The new Liveboard experience introduces notable changes, new menu options, and enhancements.

Liveboard editing::
To edit a Liveboard, users must switch to the edit mode by clicking the *Edit* button on the Liveboard page. For example, to delete a visualization on a Liveboard, the user must click *Edit*, and then navigate to the *Delete* option on a visualization.

Filter application::

To apply filters, users must switch to the Liveboard edit mode. Only users with edit access to the Liveboard can apply filters. +
The new experience also introduces the following enhancements to Liveboard filters:

* The link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-filters[Liveboard filter configuration options, window=_blank] are available in a single modal.
* When a user creates a copy of a Liveboard, the filters applied to its visualizations are also copied.

Action enhancements::
* The *Add filters* action is placed on the primary menu bar and can be viewed only when a Liveboard is in edit mode.
* The *Undo*, *Redo*, and *Reset* buttons appear on visualizations when a user drills down to view specific data points on a visualization.
* The *Liveboard Info* action label in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] is renamed to *Show Liveboard details*.
* The *Schedule* action is placed in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
* The following actions are deprecated:
** The *Copy embed link* and *Copy link* menu actions in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu of a Liveboard
** The edit title icon on visualization tiles
** The *Share* button on visualizations

== Customize embedded Liveboards

=== Customize actions
You can use the `Action` enumeration members available in the SDK to customize an embedded Liveboard.

For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum.

For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Show or hide UI actions] and xref:embed-action-ref.adoc[Action Reference].

=== Trigger events

The embedded Liveboards support all host and embedded application events in the SDK irrespective of the Liveboard experience setting. For example, you can register and trigger events such as `VizPointClick` for visualizations on a Liveboard.

For information about events, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Events and app integration] and xref:events-ref.adoc[Events Reference].

=== Customize Liveboard tabs

The new Liveboard experience allows you to organize your visualizations into tabs. Liveboard tabs allow you to logically group visualization into specific categories and allow users to access them easily.

To create, edit, or move visualizations to a tab, you require edit access to a Liveboard.

* To add a tab, click *Edit* and then click *Add tab* on the Liveboard page.
+
Note that each new tab object is assigned a unique GUID.
* To add a visualization to a tab on a Liveboard, click *Move to tab* from the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
+
You can also pin a visualization to a Liveboard tab using the Pin action on the Answer page.

==== Set a tab as an active tab

By default, the first tab created on a Liveboard is set as the home tab. You can set any tab as an active tab using the `activeTabId` property in the Visual Embed SDK as shown in the example here:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardV2: true,
    liveboardId: "d7a5a08e-a1f7-4850-aeb7-0764692855b8",
    activeTabId: "05406350-44ce-488e-abc5-5e8cdd65cf3c",
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `activeTabId` property is available only in the `LiveboardEmbed` package and not supported in the full application embed mode.
====

=== Customize visualization tiles
If the custom tile size feature is enabled on your instance, and you have edit access to the Liveboard, you can resize the visualization tiles as described in the following steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard.
. On the Liveboard page, click the *Edit* button in the top menu bar.
. Select a visualization tile, click the size-changing icon in the bottom right corner, and drag the visualization tile to the desired size.
. Repeat the steps to resize other visualizations on the Liveboard.

== Add Note tiles [eaTag eaBackground]#Early Access#
Starting from 9.2.0.cl, you can add a Note tile with custom text, images, and links on an embedded Liveboard.
The Note tiles feature is turned off by default and can be enabled by your application administrator.

If this feature is enabled on your instance, note the following limitations:

* Only users with edit access to a Liveboard can add a Note tile.
* In 9.2.0.cl, only users with administration, developer, or `Can upload data` privilege can upload an image to the note tile.
* If you are adding external links and images from a URL, make sure the relevant CSP settings are configured. For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security settings].

For more information, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-note-tiles[Liveboard Note tiles, window=_blank].

=== Known issues and limitations

Note the following issues and limitations before you enable the new Liveboard experience on your embedded instance:

* The `Rename` action in the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] of an embedded Liveboard cannot be disabled or hidden using Visual Embed SDK.
* If the worksheet used for generating visualizations contains Parameters, Liveboard users can apply Parameters to Liveboard. On embedded instances,  the `Add Parameter` action on an embedded Liveboard cannot be disabled or hidden using the `Action.AddParameter` enumeration.
* The `locale` setting translates only some parts of the embedded Liveboard such as the menu action labels.
* The *Update from TML* and *Manage schedule* menu actions on embedded Liveboards show an error.
