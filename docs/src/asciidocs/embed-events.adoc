:page-description: You can subscribe to events emitted by the embedded objects and the host application.

ThoughtSpot supports a range of events that your app can listen to and respond to with an appropriate action. The embedded ThoughtSpot components emit events when they initialize and load, and when a user executes an action inside these components. The host application can also trigger events within the embedded ThoughtSpot objects, causing an alert or other action.

== How to register, handle, and trigger events

Before you begin, make sure you import the events library from the Visual Embed SDK package.

[source,javascript]
----
import { EmbedEvent, HostEvent } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

The following code snippet shows how to register the `Init` event for the embedded ThoughtSpot Liveboards.

[source, javascript]
----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Init, showLoader)
----

The `Init` event is generated when the embedded object rendering initializes. In the above example, a `showLoader` function is called to show a loader when the `Init` event triggers.

You can also subscribe to the `AuthInit` event to be notified when user authentication is successful, and `AuthExpire` to trigger an alert when an authenticated session expires.

[source, javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.AuthInit)
----

In the following example, the `AuthExpire` calls the `showAuthExpired` function to show a banner when an authenticated session expires.

[source, javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.AuthExpire, showAuthExpired)
----

Host events use the `.trigger()` method to send the event message to the ThoughtSpot embedded components.

[source, javascript]
----
liveboardEmbed.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [{
    columnName: "state",
    operator: "EQ",
    values: ["michigan"]
}]);
----

=== Custom action events

If you have added a xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[custom action], you must register an event handler to send data in a payload when the custom action is triggered:

[source, javascript]
----
searchEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.customAction, payload => {
    const data = payload.data;
    if (data.id === 'insert Custom Action ID here') {
        console.log('Custom Action event:', data.embedAnswerData);
    }
})
----

== Unsubscribe from an event

The following example shows how to unsubscribe from an event:

[source, javascript]
----
appEmbed.off(EmbedEvent.AuthInit)
----

[#host-events]
== Host events

The following host events are triggered by the host application, which the embedded ThoughtSpot app can register. All host events are part of the *HostEvent* object; for example, `HostEvent.SetVisibleVizs`. They are sent using the `.trigger(hostEvent, data)` method of the embed component.
