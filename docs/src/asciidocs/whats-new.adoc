This page provides information about new features, enhancements, and deprecated functionality in ThoughtSpot Everywhere.

== Coming soon

==== Link customization

The upcoming release allows query parameters in the Liveboard, saved answer, and visualization URLs that are customized for an embedded ThoughtSpot instance. For example, you can customize the *Unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications for KPI charts by adding `{ts-query-params}` to the visualization URL and thus allow users to unsubscribe from KPI threshold alerts at any time.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].

|[tag orangeBackground]#CHANGE NOTICE#  a| +++<h5>Pinboards are now Liveboards!</h5> +++ 

Effective from the ThoughtSpot 8 November Cloud release, ThoughtSpot pinboards are rebranded as Liveboards and optimized for live analytics in cloud deployments. Along with granular insights, Liveboards offer interactive data analytics experience with enhanced capabilities. 

As part of rebranding, we have made some terminology changes in the ThoughtSpot UI and Developer portal. We are in the process of rolling out terminology changes across all ThoughtSpot interfaces, platforms, and information artifacts. During this period, your environment may show some instances of `pinboard` based on the rebranding rollout stage. In some cases, we may even continue to use the legacy terminology for backward compatibility, and to ensure that your existing integrations work seamlessly. For more information, see xref:terminology-update.adoc[Terminology changes].

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
|[tag orangeBackground]#MODIFIED# a|+++<h5> Custom actions feature availability</h5>+++

Starting from ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud October release, you _do not_ require a separate ThoughtSpot Everywhere Edition license to create or manage custom actions. The *Custom action* feature is unlocked on all clusters that have a valid ThoughtSpot Enterprise Cloud service subscription. ThoughtSpot Cloud service users with Developer or Admin privileges can access the *Custom actions* feature in the *Develop* tab.

|[tag redBackground]#REMOVED# a|+++<h5>The Only allow in context menu checkbox</<h5> +++

The *Only allow in context menu* checkbox in the custom action creation dialog is removed from the UI. This checkbox was available in previous releases to allow developers to set a custom action to appear only in the contextual menu on pinboard visualizations, charts, or tables.

If you have created custom actions with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled on your instance, note these custom action workflow changes:

* If you have a *Global* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled, the configuration setting _is not_ preserved and the action is placed in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu instead of the contextual menu.
+
You can xref:custom-actions-edit.adoc[modify the position of this action] by using the *Edit* option in the *Custom actions* panel on a visualization or search results page.

* If you have a *Local* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled and the action is already assigned to a worksheet, visualization, chart, or table, the configuration setting _is_ preserved and the custom action shows up in the contextual menu.

* If you have a *Local* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled, but it is not assigned to a worksheet, visualization, chart, or table, the action will not be available as a menu item or button. You must add the action to a visualization, chart, or table, and configure its position as required. For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a visualization] and xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[Add custom actions to a worksheet].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>shouldEncodeUrlQueryParams</h5>+++

You can now convert query parameters in the ThoughtSpot generated URLs to base64-encoded format. You can enable this attribute to secure your cluster from cross-site scripting attacks.
|[tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE# a| +++<h5>Data structure changes in custom action response payloads</h5>+++

* The  data structure passed in the custom action response for search now shows as `payload.data.embedAnswerData` instead of `payload.data.columnsAndData`.

* The answer payload for custom actions includes the following metadata:

** `reportBookmetadata`
+
Includes visualization metadata attributes such as description, object header metadata, author details, timestamp of the answer creation, and modification.

** user data
+
Includes user information such as username, GUID of the user, and email address.

To view a sample response payload, see xref:callback-response-payload.adoc#search-data-payload[Custom action response payload].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>preventPinboardFilterRemoval</h5>+++

The `pinboardEmbed` SDK package now includes the `preventPinboardFilterRemoval` attribute. You can use this attribute to disable the filter removal action and thus prevent users from removing the filter chips added on a pinboard page.

For more information, see xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a pinboard] and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization].
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>suppressNoCookieAccessAlert</h5>+++

You can now set custom alerts for `noCookieAccess` events. By default, the SDK triggers a `noCookieAccess` event and generates an alert when a user's browser blocks third-party cookies. The `suppressNoCookieAccessAlert` allows you to disable this alert.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>Support for fetching callback custom action payload in batches</h5>+++

The Visual Embed SDK now supports processing data in batches for callback custom action responses.
The callback custom action event in the SDK package supports defining `batchSize` and `offset` values to paginate the answer payload and send the records in batches.

For more information, see xref:push-data-to-external-app.adoc#large-dataset[Callback custom action workflow].

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud August release introduces several new APIs to xref:user-api.adoc[manage users], xref:group-api.adoc[user groups], xref:admin-api.adoc[cluster configuration], xref:dependency-apis.adoc[object dependencies], and so on.

For a complete list of APIs, see xref:rest-api-reference.adoc[REST API Reference].

.Custom actions
[%collapsible]
====

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Global and local custom actions</h5>+++

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports configuring a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations, or a specific custom action that can be added to a visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. The custom actions panel in the visualization page allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Authentication schemes for custom actions</h5>+++

You can now apply an authentication scheme for a custom action that triggers a data payload to a specific URL target. If an action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.
ThoughtSpot will use this information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|
+++<h5>Custom action position settings</h5>+++

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

.Custom link format for embedded instances
[%collapsible]
====

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].
