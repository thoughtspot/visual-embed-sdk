:page-description: New features and enhancements

This page lists the new features and enhancements introduced in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal, Visual Embed SDK, and REST APIs.

== June 2021

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

== Custom actions
This release introduces the following new features and enhancements are introduced for custom actions:

=== Global and local custom actions 

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports designating a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations or a specific custom action that can be added to a particular visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. A custom actions panel in the visualization pages allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization. 

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

=== Authentication schemes for custom actions

You can now apply an authentication scheme for custom actions that trigger a data payload to a specific URL target. If a custom action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.

ThoughtSpot will use this authentication information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

=== Custom action position settings

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time. 

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

== Custom link format for ThoughtSpot embedded instances

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and search answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context. 

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].

== REST APIs

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following REST APIs:

* `POST /tspublic/v1/security/share`
+
You can use this API to share ThoughtSpot objects with another user or user group. For more information, see xref:security-api.adoc#share-object[Share objects with another user].

* `POST /tspublic/v1/security/shareviz` 
+
You can use this API to share a specific ThoughtSpot visualization with another user or user group. For more information, see xref:security-api.adoc##shareviz[Share a visualization with another user or user group].  

* `GET /tspublic/v1/session/login/token`
+
This API allows you to authenticate and log in a user if trusted authentication is enabled on ThoughtSpot. For more information, see xref:session-api.adoc#session-loginToken[Authenticate and log in a user]. 

* `POST /tspublic/v1/metadata/assigntag`
+
You can use this API to programmatically assign a tag to a ThoughtSpot object such as pinboards, search answers, tables, and worksheets. For more information, see xref:metadata-api.adoc#assign-tag[Assign tags to metadata objects].

=== Other API enhancements
The *`/tspublic/v1/user/updatepreference`* API now includes the optional `username` parameter to allow API users to specify the `username` of the ThoughtSpot user whose profile is being modified. 
For more information, see xref:user-api.adoc#updatepreference-api[Update a user profile].

== May 2021
The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud May consists of several new and enhanced features for the  ThoughtSpot Developer users.

=== Custom actions in the context menu
You can now add a custom action to the contextual menu to send data or initiate an action from an embedded visualization. The *Customization* > *Actions* page in the *Develop* tab allows you to add a custom action to the contextual menu for visualizations in the *Search Answers* or *Pinboards* page. 

[NOTE]
This feature is available only if the  link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[New Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance.  

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Add custom actions]. 

=== Visual Embed SDK 1.2.0
The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud May release introduces the Visual Embed SDK 1.2.0 version with minor updates and backward-compatible improvements. 

==== SAML authentication
The Visual Embed SDK packages now include the `noRedirect` attribute as an optional parameter for  the `SSO` `AuthType`. If you want to display the SAML authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see the instructions for embedding xref:full-embed.adoc[ThoughtSpot pages], xref:embed-search.adoc[search], xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[pinboard], and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations].

==== Visual Embed SDK notification when third-party cookies are disabled
When a user accesses the embedded application from a web browser that has third-party cookies disabled, the Visual Embed SDK emits the `NoCookieAccess` event to notify the developer. Cookies are disabled by default in Safari. Users can enable third-party cookies in Safari’s Preferences setting page or use another web browser.
To know how to enable this setting by default on Safari for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.  

For more information on allowing third-party cookies on Safari, see xref:browser-settings.adoc[Browser settings for embedding].

==== Pinboard embed enhancements
The *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] in the embedded Pinboard page now shows the following actions for pinboard and visualizations. 

Pinboard::
* Save 
* Make a copy
* Add filters  
* Configure filters  
* Present
* Download as PDF
* Pinboard info
* Manage schedules

[NOTE]
Users with edit permissions can view and access the *Save*, *Add filters*, *Configure filters*, and *Manage schedules* actions.
 
Visualizations on a pinboard::
* Pin
* Download
* Edit
* Present
* Download as CSV
* Download as XLSX  
* Download as PDF 

[NOTE]
Users with edit permissions can view and access the *Edit* action. The *Download as CSV*, *Download as XSLX*, and *Download as PDF* actions are available for table visualizations. The *Download* action is available for chart visualizations.

==== Performance optimization
This release introduces the following performance improvements for ThoughtSpot embedded applications:

* Faster loading of embedded objects and application pages.
* Faster loading of preview results in the Playground. 
 
=== REST APIs
The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud May release introduces the following REST APIs:

* `*POST* /tspublic/v1/user/updatepreference`
+
You can use this API to programmatically update a ThoughtSpot user's profile settings such as the email address, locale preference, notification settings, and the preference for revisiting the onboarding experience. For more information, see xref:user-api.adoc#updatepreference-api[User API].

* `*GET* /tspublic/v1/metadata/listas` 
+
You can use this API to get a list of object headers for a ThoughtSpot user or user group. For more information, see xref:metadata-api.adoc#headers-metadata-users[Metadata API].
