ThoughtSpot is a business intelligence and data analytics platform that helps you explore, analyze and share real-time business analytics and interactive insights. Besides being an interactive data analytics platform, ThoughtSpot provides a robust and guided search functionality using which business users can search data instantly. ThoughtSpot is different from other BI tools, because ThoughtSpot Search is the core of the ThoughtSpot system.

Before you look at the rest of the developer documentation, please review this page to understand how ThoughtSpot works relative to other tools you may be familiar with.

== Object model hierarchy

The following figure illustrates the object model hierarchy in ThoughtSpot.

== Data modeling
You must create a data model comprising at least one link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections[connection, window=_blank] with one link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connect-data[table, window=_blank] to begin using link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/search-data[Search data, window=_blank] to create content. Most often there will be multiple *tables*, with a variety of link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tables-join[joins, window=_blank] defined in ThoughtSpot, with a link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/worksheet-create[worksheet, window=_blank] bringing those tables together into a presentable analytic data model for the end-users.

Data engineers with *Can manage data* privilege can add connections either link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections[in the UI, window=_blank] or via xref:connections-api.adoc[REST API]. Connections are owned and accessible only to their creator, who then imports *tables* from the connection. Once imported, tables can be shared with other Thoughtspot groups and users.

*Tables* can have link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/security-rls[Row Level Security (RLS), window=_blank] rules that filter the data results based on the signed-in link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/user-management[username, window=_blank] or the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/group-management[ThoughtSpot groups, window=_blank] to which the user belongs, and those rules apply to any *worksheet* that uses the *table*.

=== Data modeling workflow
1. Create a *connection* to a cloud data warehouse.
2. Import *tables* from the *connection*.
3. Create *worksheets* (analytic data models) based on *tables*.
4. Create *link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/views[ThoughtSpot views, window=_blank]* or *link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/sql-views[SQL views, window=_blank]* as necessary.

ThoughtSport supports programmatic deployment of data models through link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/spotapps[Spotapps, window=_blank], link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/scriptability[scriptability, window=_blank], and data representation in link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML), window=_blank].

== Content creation
ThoughtSpot Search data creates a single table or chart view based on the query in the search bar and other configurations to the view made after the search results are visible.

Search data serves the role of report builder or widget designer, while *Liveboards* serve the role of dashboards in other tools. A single search can be saved as an link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/answers[answer, window=_blank] object, or the search result can be pinned to a Liveboard.

A link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard[Liveboard, window=_blank] is a collection of many visualizations presented in a defined layout. You do not create the visualizations on a Liveboard directly; they are created from search data results and then pinned to a Liveboard. You can create a new Liveboard from the *Liveboards* page and then add a visualization from the search data result, or you can create a new Liveboard when pinning an answer retrieved from search data.

=== Content creation workflow

To create content:

1. Use the *link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/search-data[Search data, window=_blank]* functionality to build visualizations from data sources such as *worksheets* or *views*.
2. Save the search result as an *Answer* or pin it to a Liveboard as a visualization.

=== Visualizations on a Liveboard 
You can add any number of visualizations retrieved from the search to a Liveboard object. Pinned visualizations exist only within the Liveboard and are independent of the objects saved as *answers*.

Each time you pin a search result, a separate new visualization is created on the Liveboard.

To edit a visualization on a Liveboard:

. Go to the Liveboard.
. Navigate to the visualization.
. Click the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] and select *Edit*.

Visualizations on a Liveboard have their own GUIDs, but the visualization objects do not exist separately from the Liveboard object.

=== Tags
link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tags[Tags, window=_blank] allow you to organize your objects and find them easily.

A tag object is created by the administrator, is visible to all users, and can be assigned by any user.

Tag search is always an *OR* operation: filtering on multiple tags results in all objects with any of the tags, not just those with all of the specified tags.

== Access control (sharing)
ThoughtSpot's link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/data-security[access control model, window=_blank] works by an `author` or `administrator` sharing objects to link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/groups-privileges[ThoughtSpot groups, window=_blank] or other individual users:

* The creator of an object is referred to as the *author*.
* The author can share the object with their groups using the *Shareable* property.
* The author can share the object with other users in *Shareable* groups that the *author* belongs to, and if the other *user* is also marked *Shareable*.

An administrator user can share any object with any group or user with no restrictions. ThoughtSpot administrators can add users locally link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/user-management[in the UI, window=_blank] or via xref:user-api.adoc[REST API]. Similarly, they can manage groups and sharing privileges by using the *Groups* feature in the UI or via REST API.

=== Single sign-on
If link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/authentication-integration[SAML, window=_blank] or link:configure-oidc.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC)] integration support is enabled on your instance, users that authenticate to external identity providers (IdP) can log in to ThoughtSpot with their Single Sign-On credentials.
Embedded ThoughtSpot instances also support the xref:trusted-authentication.adoc[trusted authentication] method to sign in their application users.

== Object properties in REST API
The object representations in ThoughtSpot REST API include the following properties:

* `id` +
GUID of the object. Unique within a given ThoughtSpot instance
* `author` +
GUID of the user who created / uploaded the object, or had the object transferred to them.
* `owner` +
GUID representing the relationship between hierarchical objects, For example, a *column* would have the GUID of a *table* or *worksheet* as owner.
* `created` +
timestamp of object creation
* `modified` +
timestamp from last time object was modified
* `modifiedBy` +
GUID of the user who last modified the object
* `tags` +
An array of tag objects representing the tags assigned to the object.

== Object names in REST API v1
The object type names in the ThoughtSpot REST API v1 differ from the current names seen in the ThoughtSpot UI. Data objects have both a `type` and a `sub-type` within the REST API, allowing you to request all valid data objects or specify the individual sub-type.

The following notation is used in REST API v1 for the object types:

* *Answers*: `QUESTION_ANSWER_BOOK`
* *Liveboards*: `PINBOARD_ANSWER_BOOK`
* *Data objects*: `LOGICAL_TABLE`, with subtypes:
** *Tables*: `ONE_TO_ONE_LOGICAL`
** *Worksheets*: `WORKSHEET`
** *Views*: `AGGR_WORKSHEET`
** *SQL views*: `SQL_VIEW`
** *CSV imported data*: `USER_DEFINED`
* *Connections*: `DATA_SOURCE`
* *Tags*: `TAG`
* *Users*: `USER`
* *Groups*: `USER_GROUP`
* *Joins*: `LOGICAL_RELATIONSHIP`
* *Columns*: `LOGICAL_COLUMN`

Column and join objects with their own GUIDs do exist within the ThoughtSpot system, but they are connected to *tables*,  *worksheets*, or other data objects.  Columns and joins can be viewed or modified only within the context of the data object to which they belong.
