:page-description: Show or hide actions in embedded pinboards and visualizations

ThoughtSpot visualization, pinboards, and answer pages include menu actions that perform various operations. Some of these actions are presented as primary actions on a pinboard or answer page, whereas some appear as menu items in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], or the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on a visualization.

== Disable or hide actions in Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK allows you to configure menu components for embedded pinboard and visualization pages. By default, the standard menu actions are *enabled* on all embedded instances. You can disable or hide specific menu actions in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] or primary action bar in the visualization or pinboard page.

The SDK packages include the `disabledActions` and `hiddenActions` attributes and action enumerators that disable or hide the specified actions.

For a complete list of menu actions and the corresponding strings to use for disabling or hiding an action, see link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank] or below in the Supported menu actions section.

=== Disable actions

If you want to restrict user access to certain actions in the embedded ThoughtSpot pinboard, visualization, or search results page, you can disable these actions in the embed config view.

The `disabledActions` attribute in the Visual Embed SDK allows you to specify one or several actions  and disable these actions on a pinboard, answer, or visualization page.

For example, to disable the *Show underlying data* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], you can specify the `ShowUnderlyingData` action string in the `disabledActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.ShowUnderlyingData]
----


++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

Similarly, to disable multiple actions, you can specify the action strings in the `disabledActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.AddFilter, Action.Present]
----


++++

<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

=== Disable a custom action

ThoughtSpot allows you to create custom actions for your embedded instance in the Developer portal. If you want to disable a custom action, you can specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute.

For example, if a custom action is labeled as *Send Email* and its ID is set as *send-email*, specify `send-email` in the `disabledActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----

disabledActions: [Action.send-email]
----

=== Add a tooltip for disabled attributes

To add a tooltip for the disabled attribute, you can specify the message text string in the `disabledActionReason` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActionReason: "Contact your administrator to enable this action"
----


++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

=== Hide actions

The Visual Embed SDK allows you to hide the actions that are not required for your application context.

To hide an action, specify the action string in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

For example:

[source,JavaScript]
----

hiddenActions: [Action.AddFilter, Action.Share]
----


++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

=== Hide a custom action

To hide a custom action, specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute.
For example, if a custom action is labeled as *Send Email* and its ID is set as *send-email*, specify `send-email` in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: [Action.send-email]
----
