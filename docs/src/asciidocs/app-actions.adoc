:page-title: App actions for business application integration
:page-pageid: app-actions
:page-description: You can add an app action to send data to a third-party business application workspace such as Slack channels.

ThoughtSpot supports integrating your application instance with business apps such as Slack. With this integration capability, business users and analysts can now push insights to their application workspace, notify their teams, and view data in context.

ThoughtSpot automates and simplifies the integration workflow with app actions and secures data transactions between the source and destination apps with OAuth authentication and authorization. App actions allow ThoughtSpot to automatically establish a pipeline with the destination app and thus eliminate the need for building connectors or programs for application integration. Your application users can quickly get started and push data to their workspace in a few simple steps.
