= Embed charts and tables  
:toc: true

This page explains, through an example, how to embed either a ThoughtSpot visualization (table or chart) in your Web page, portal, or application.
////
To build this sample, you must have access to a text editor and a ThoughtSpot instance with a visualization.
Experience working with Javascript also helps.
////
=== Import the SDK Library

[source,javascript]
----
<add codeblock>
----

=== Initialize the SDK

[source,javascript]
----
<add codeblock>
----
=== Construct the embed content
 
[source,JavaScript]
----
 var protocol = "THOUGHTSPOT_PROTOCOL";
 var hostPort = "HOST_PORT";

 var vizualizationId = "VIZUALIZATON_ID";
----

. Edit each variable in the section and replace it with the IDs you copied from the pinboard.

For example, your URL may look similar to the following:

----
http://172.18.202.35:8088/#/embed/viz/061457a2-27bc-43a9-9754-0cd873691bf0/9985fccf-b28d-4262-b54b-29619a38348e+`

----
This is a link copied from an individual visualization, the result in the file is:


[source,JavaScript]
----
 var protocol = "http";
 var hostPort = "172.18.202.35:8088";

 var pinboardId = "061457a2-27bc-43a9-9754-0cd873691bf0";
 var vizualizationId = "9985fccf-b28d-4262-b54b-29619a38348e";
----
