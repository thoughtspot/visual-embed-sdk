:page-description: Get started with REST API v2 to access, create, and manage ThoughtSpot resources programmatically.

To get started with REST API v2, you will require access to REST API v2 Playground and SDK. To enable this feature on your cluster, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

== Access the Playground

To access the REST API v2 Playground, go to **Develop** > **REST API** > **REST Playground v2**.

The Playground allows you to make API calls, view the request and response workflows, and download code samples.

++++

== Set up your environment

By default, your cluster URL is set as the base URI. 

////
You can modify the base URI in the Playground code explorer.

. In the code explorer, click **Configure**.

+
The configuration panel appears.

. In the *Client Configuration* section, specify the base URI.
////
If you want to call REST API in a language-specific way, download the language-specific SDK and set up your environment.

For more information about language-specific SDK and client libraries, see xref:rest-api-sdk-libraries.adoc[REST API SDK and client libraries]. 
 
== Authorize your client

To provide secure access to ThoughtSpot resources, the REST API v2 framework supports OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens and the trusted authentication method. For local development or test environments, you can use basic authentication with `userName` and `password`. 

[NOTE]
====
The examples in this article show how to obtain an OAuth access token and authorize your API requests. For information about other types of authentication, see xref:authentication.adoc[REST v2 Authentication].
====

To get an OAuth access token, send a `POST` request to the `/tspublic/rest/v2/session/gettoken` endpoint.

----
POST /tspublic/rest/v2/session/gettoken
----

In the request body, specify your ThoughtSpot user credentials. Optionally, you can set a token expiry duration. 

[source,curl]
----
 "userName": "tsadmin",
 "password": "123CLOud!",
 "tokenExpiryDuration": "120000"
----

If the request is successful, the server returns an OAuth access token in the session login response.

----
"userName":"tsadmin"
"token":"dHNhZG1pbjpKSE5vYVhKdk1TUlRTRUV0TWpVMkpEVXdNREF3TUNSRGRVZFRLM2hQUzNKUVNUSm1jMnBsTlRNdmMwVkJQVDBrTmsxeFZYWmhNR2R1TUVabFQzTXZiSE5qTW5ONVdfdG1Zalo0ZFVSTWIyNXZWVmRtTWxGeWEwVnhORDA="
"tokenCreatedTime":"1642662844229"
"tokenExpiryDuration":"1642749244229"
"tokenType":"Bearer"
----

[NOTE]
====
By default, the OAuth access token is valid for 24 hours. If you make an API call with an expired token, the server returns an error. You can configure the token expiry duration as per your requirement or request for a new access token and use it in your subsequent API calls.
====

== Make an API call

To make a REST API call, send a request to the endpoint URL and pass the parameters. 

For example, to get a list of metadata objects, send a `POST` request to the `/tspublic/rest/v2/metadata/header/search`.

----
POST /tspublic/rest/v2/metadata/header/search
----

=== Request header

Each API call must include the following headers.

* `'Authorization: Bearer {OAUTH_TOKEN}'`
+
The authorization header must include the OAuth token obtained from ThoughtSpot.

* `'Content-Type: application/json'`
+
The header to indicate the content type for the request body. 

* `'Accept-Language: application/json'`
+
The `Accept` header for API response format. 

* `X-Requested-By` __Optional__
+
The `'X-Requested-By: ThoughtSpot'` header in API requests to ThoughtSpot REST endpoints. 

* `User-Agent`
+
The `User-Agent` header is required for all requests.  Most clients will add the `User-Agent` header automatically. However, when making API calls from code, especially `.NET`, you must add the `User-Agent` header. 

+
The `User-Agent` can be any string; for example, you can set the header as `'User-Agent: <browser>/<browser-version><os/platform>'`.

=== Request parameters

Most APIs require you to specify at least one parameter. For example, to view the details of a user object, you can specify either user GUID or the user name. 

The API Playground indicates the required and optional parameters and provides information about the data type and allowed values. For example, to get a list of answers, you must specify the metadata `type` as `Answer`. 

The following example shows the CURL request format to get a list of answers saved in the ThoughtSpot system.

[source,curl]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url '<ThoughtSpot-host>/tspublic/rest/v2/metadata/header/search' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {OAUTH_TOKEN}'\
  -H 'Accept-Language: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "type": "ANSWER"
}'
----

If the API request is successful, ThoughtSpot returns a list of object headers for the requested object type.

[source,JSON]
----

   "headers":[
      {
         "id":"92f48c07-9c62-4bfa-81ac-55f3049165b4",
         "indexVersion":5,
         "generationNum":705,

         "isAutoCreated":false,
         "isAutoDelete":false,
         "tags":[
            
         ],
         "isExternal":false,
         "isDeprecated":false
      }
   ],
   "isLastBatch":true
}
----

=== HTTP status codes

The REST API v2 framework supports standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. 

* *200*
+
Indicates a successful operation. The API returns a response body.

* *500*
+
Indicates an internal server error. Make sure the data format of the request is correct and check if the server is available and can process your request. You may also want to check the error codes in the response body. For example, when a request is unauthorized, the API returns a 500 error and shows the error code as 401 in the response body. 

If your API call returns an error in the Playground, you can view the error details under `extensions` > `upstreamResponse` > `data` > `debug` in the response body.

To view the error response code, go to `extensions` > `upstreamResponse` > `status` in the error response body.
