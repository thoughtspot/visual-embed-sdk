[#embedSSO]
== Embedded SSO authentication

Embedded SSO authentication simplifies the authentication process for embedded applications. The Embedded SSO method allows you to leverage your existing IdP setup and the SAML or OIDC configuration on ThoughtSpot. If enabled in the SDK, this authentication method seamlessly redirects users to their IdP within the ThoughtSpot iframe when ThoughtSpot content loads in the embedded app.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.EmbeddedSSO,
});
----

[#trusted-auth-embed]
== Trusted authentication

In the trusted authentication method, a security token is required to authenticate users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content. For trusted authentication, you will require an authenticator server or service, which can securely authenticate your application users.

For trusted authentication setup, the following attributes are required:

* Secret key
+
The token-based authentication requires you to xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[enable trusted authentication] on ThoughtSpot to ensure that your authenticator server has access to a ThoughtSpot secret key. This secret key allows the authenticator server to request a login token __for any user__ on the ThoughtSpot Server. The login token is then sent to the user's web browser, where it is used in the login process.

* Username
+
The `username` of the user for whom the token is being requested.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To obtain a token and log in the user, the user must already be created in ThoughtSpot. For just-in-time (JIT) provisioning of a user and group assignment, the authenticator service can use the `autocreate` and `group` properties in xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token] API endpoint.
====

* Authentication endpoint
+
The URL endpoint of the server that provides the authentication token.

[NOTE]
====
Trusted authentication requires xref:security-settings.adoc#cors-hosts[setting up CORS] so that your application can call ThoughtSpot to authenticate your user.
====

=== Steps to configure trusted authentication in Visual Embed SDK

To configure the trusted authentication method in the Visual Embed SDK, set the `authType` attribute as `TrustedAuthToken`.

To obtain authentication tokens, you can either set the `authEndPoint` attribute or call the `getAuthToken` method:

* `**authEndpoint**`
+
Specify the authentication endpoint URL from which you want to obtain the authentication token. When an API request is sent to the specified endpoint URL, the authentication server sends the token as plain text.

+
[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthToken,
    username: "<username>",
    authEndpoint: "https://authenticator-server:<port>/endpoint",
});
----

* `**getAuthToken**` +

+
You can call the `getAuthToken` function to invoke your login endpoint. The login endpoint then returns a `Promise` string that resolves to an authentication token.

+
[NOTE]
====
The generated authentication token is valid for only five minutes. Make sure the `getAuthToken` function returns a fresh token for each re-login.
Using older tokens to renew a user session will lead to authentication failure.
====

+
[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthToken,
    username: "<username>",
    getAuthToken: () => {
 	return fetch(`https://your-remote-url.com/some/path/${username}`)
	    .then(response => response.json())
	    .then(json => json.token);
    },
});
----

+
After obtaining the token, a `POST` request is sent to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login/token` API endpoint with `username` and authentication token in the request body. If the request is successful, the SDK renders the embedded content.

==== Autologin and redirects

When a user session expires, the embedded app redirects its users to the login page. To refresh a user session and automatically log in a user to the embedded app, you can set the `disableLoginRedirect` and `autoLogin` attributes to `true`.

----
disableLoginRedirect: true,
autoLogin: true,
----

Unlike the SAML workflow, the trusted authentication workflow logs in via AJAX requests that are not visible to the end-user, even if they fail. Use the event emitter returned by the `init` call to listen to the login failure events. You can also register an event handler to trigger the xref:embed-events.adoc[AuthInit event] to detect and respond to errors in the login process.

[#saml-sso-embed]
== SAMLRedirect authentication
If your IdP supports SAML SSO to authenticate and does not support iFrame redirects, you can configure the `SAMLRedirect` auth type to authenticate your embedded application users. If this authentication method is enabled, the SDK redirects your app to the IdP login page for user authentication when the embedded content loads.

To use SAML SSO authentication, the administrator must enable SAML authentication on ThoughtSpot and xref:configure-saml.adoc#saml-redirect[add the SAML redirect domains to the allowed list] on the *Security Settings* page in the *Develop* tab. For more information, see xref:configure-saml.adoc#_saml_authentication_workflow_for_a_thoughtspot_embedded_instance[SAML authentication workflow for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance].

=== Enable SAMLRedirect authentication in Visual Embed SDK

To configure SAML SSO authentication with redirects, set the `authType` attribute to `SAMLRedirect`.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.SAMLRedirect,
});
----

The SAML authentication workflow occurs when the actual ThoughtSpot content is loaded into the iframe generated by the Visual Embed SDK.  If the user is not logged into the IdP, the IdP presents its login page. When the user enters SSO credentials, the IdP sends the assertion to ThoughtSpot. The user should have already gone through the SAML flow when entering the embedding application before accessing any ThoughtSpot content.

For a seamless SSO experience, the user must already have a valid session with the IdP, so that the IdP can automatically send a SAML assertion back to ThoughtSpot.

=== SAML redirection

If you want the SAML SSO authentication workflow to terminate on a specific path on the host origin, you can set the redirect path in the `redirectPath` attribute. For example, when a user's attempt to sign on using SSO fails, you might want to redirect your users to the main page or a specific application page, instead of showing your application in an error state.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.SAMLRedirect,
    redirectPath: "/dashboard",
});
----

If you want the SAML SSO authentication page to open as a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application page to show the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` parameter to `true`.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.SAMLRedirect,
    noRedirect: true,
});
----

[#oidc-auth]
== OpenID Connect SSO authentication

If your app supports OAuth 2.0 protocol and OIDC authentication framework and uses an OpenId Provider for user authentication, your application users can authenticate to an OpenID provider when the embedded content loads. Make sure your ThoughtSpot instance is xref:configure-oidc.adoc[configured to support OIDC authentication]. If your OpenID provider does not support iFrame redirects, you can configure the `OIDCRedirect` authentication method to redirect your app to the OpenID Provider login page.


[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.OIDCRedirect,
});
----

Optionally, you can configure a `redirectPath` string to redirect embed users to a specific application page.

----
redirectPath: "/dashboard"
----


[#none]
== No authentication (pass-through) method
If your application already uses an IdP to authenticate users and allows iframe embedding, and your ThoughtSpot instance has SAML or OIDC configured, you can set the `authType` attribute to `None`. The `None` authentication method can leverage user authentication taking place outside of the embedded application context. The SDK won't do additional authentication and acts as a pass-through.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

[#basic-auth-embed]
== Basic authentication

The basic authentication option in the SDK sends a `POST` request with the `username` and `password` of the user to the `xref:session-api.adoc#session-login[/tspublic/v1/session/login]` API endpoint. This option uses the `username` and `password` parameters in the `init()` function to sign in. Passwords should never be hard-coded into your code unless you have a dedicated "public service account user" expressly for the purpose and without worries about security.

[NOTE]
====
Basic authentication requires xref:security-settings.adoc#cors-hosts[setting up CORS] so that your application can call ThoughtSpot to authenticate your user.
====

To enable the basic authentication method in the Visual Embed SDK, set the `authType` attribute to `Basic` as shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.Basic,
    username: "username",
    password: "password"
});
----

[WARNING]
====
ThoughtSpot does not recommend this authentication method for production environments.
====


== Authentication errors and event handling

The user authentication may fail due to an incomplete SSO login process, expired user session, SDK initialization error, or if the browser has blocked third-party cookies.

The `init` method returns an event emitter, which you can use to listen to `AuthStatus` such as authentication failure, success, or user logout, and respond to these events with a message or corrective action.

[source,Typescript]
----
authStatus = init(embedConfig); authStatus.on(AuthStatus.FAILURE, (reason) => {
console.log('Authentication failed');
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `EventEmitter` returned from `init`  is used only for listening to authentication status events such as `AuthStatus.SUCCESS`, `AuthStatus.FAILURE`, and `AuthStatus.LOGOUT`.
====

If you want to display a message in the embedded UI when a user login fails, include the `loginFailedMessage` property in your `init` call.
By default, the attribute displays the `Not logged in` message in the embedded UI. To customize this message, define a string with custom text or markup as shown here:

----
loginFailedMessage: "Authentication failed! Please try again."
----

----
loginFailedMessage: "<div> <h3> Please enable third-party cookies</h3> <img src='<image url'> </div>"
----

You can also register event handlers to trigger the following events:

* `NoCookieAccess`
+
Emitted if cookies are restricted by a user's browser.

* `AuthExpire`
+
Emitted if the SSO does not complete and if the ThoughtSpot session times out at some point.

* `AuthInit`
+
Emitted when the authentication is completed.

For more information about triggering these events, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Interact with events].

== User logout

To log out embed users, you can use the `Logout` method to call the `xref:session-api.adoc#session-logout[/callosum/v1/session/logout]` API endpoint.

[source,Typescript]
----
import { logout } from "@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk";

 // call this somewhere
logout();
----

The `logout` function returns a promise that resolves when the user is logged out of ThoughtSpot. When you call `logout`, the `autoLogin` attribute is set to `false` to prevent the SDK from automatically logging in the user again. If you do not want to disable `autoLogin`, set the `doNotDisableAutoLogin` parameter to `false`.

You can also call `init` again with the `autoLogin` property set to `true` to re-login a user.
