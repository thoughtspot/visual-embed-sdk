# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
    push:
        branches: [main, release]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main, release]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
